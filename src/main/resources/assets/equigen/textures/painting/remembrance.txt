Jacob, while It's been a long time since we've spoken, it will be even longer before we speak again. I may not have been
the best of friends, nor did I treat you as respectfully as I should have, but you will still hold a place in my heart
until the day I die. Everyone around me believes that you were nothing more than Madeleine's brother to me, however I
remember all the good times we had together when we were younger. I always respected your ability to simply be yourself.
You were never afraid to share what you enjoyed or believed. You always had a way of bringing the mood up especially when
Madeleine was down. While towards the end you may have been seen as "annoying" (in an endearing way), I saw more than that.
I saw a brother who cared for his family more than anything else in this world. Not only that, but as time passes I
realize your "family" extended to your friends as well. Everyone loved you, and I hope somewhere in Heaven, you never
forget that.

I can't wait to see you once more in the promised land.
May God bless your soul, and may you find peace in the afterlife.
